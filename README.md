# Squeak
My audio program Squeak compiles audio singles/one shots into a single layered music loop.

It uses the left/right mouse buttons plus the two side buttons to attach audio clips, play them on the Canvas and generate a complete track.

(with version 1.0.3) In addition to creating music generated from the SqueakBack, you can now record the playback from your speakers or headset through a preset duration.

This program is meant to compliment other audio production software and is by no means a complete solution by itself.
