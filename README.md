# Squeak Music Alchemy
My audio program Squeak compiles audio singles/one shots into a single channel music loop.

It uses the left/right mouse buttons plus the two side buttons to attach audio clips, play them on the Canvas and generate a complete track.

This program is meant to compliment other audio production software and is by no means a complete solution by itself.
